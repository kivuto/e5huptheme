## Description
This is the theme for HUP (Home Use Program) webstores in e5. It has a javascript file (hup.js) a css file (hup.css) and 2 images (hup-banner.jpg, ms-hup-logo.jpg) that make up the theme. The javascript is used to switch the order of the top right hand navigations.

The image hup-banner.jpg is to be used as the banner to be applied to all new stores. I belive this was how the DSP theme was set up as well.

## Tasks for Implementation by Development Team

1. Swap out all images references to *git.onthehub.com* with *Static* equivalent in hup.css
2. Make a folder in static for UAT environment called ‘e5 hup theme v1’
2. Put JS file in the folder
3. Put the CSS file in the fold
4. If the webstore has no banner attachement use the file hup-banner.jpg as the default.
5. Make a new theme in e5 and call it ‘Home Use Program v1’
6. Test theme and make sure both the CSS and JS file are being loaded on the page. You can check against a mock up found in the theme contents to verify it is working (you’ll know if it isn’t)
